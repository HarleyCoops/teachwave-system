These methods provide different insights and are appropriate for different scenarios.</p><p><h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4\">Key Formulas</h3></p><p>1. <strong>Time-weighted Return (TWR)</strong>: This method calculates the geometric mean of the portfolio returns over each period, adjusting for the effects of cash flows. It is not influenced by the timing or size of cash flows and is more appropriate for comparing fund performance since it isolates the manager's investment skill from the effects of cash inflows and outflows.</p><p>   <div class=\"flex justify-center\"><Math display=\"true\" math=\"\\TWR = \\\\prod_{i=1}^{N} (1 + R_i)^{\\\\dfrac{1}{N}} - 1\" /></div></p><p>   where <Math math=\"R_i\" /> is the portfolio return for period <Math math=\"i\" /> and <Math math=\"N\" /> is the number of periods.</p><p>2. <strong>Money-weighted Return (MWR)</strong>: This method considers the timing and size of cash flows and is equivalent to the internal rate of return (IRR) of the portfolio cash flows. It is more reflective of the actual growth experienced by the investor, considering the impact of cash flows.</p><p>   <div class=\"flex justify-center\"><Math display=\"true\" math=\"\\MWR = \\IRR \\\\quad \\solving for \\\\quad \\\\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\\\dfrac{C_t}{(1 + \\MWR)^t} = 0\" /></div></p><p>   where <Math math=\"C_t\" /> is the cash flow at time <Math math=\"t\" />.</p></div>",

Time-weighted returns reflect the portfolio manager's skill by minimizing the impact of cash flows, making them ideal for comparisons. Money-weighted returns, on the other hand, capture the investor's actual experience by incorporating cash flows. Always remember which perspective you're examining when choosing between these Returns! </p><p>Consider time-weighted return when you're comparing managers or investments with different levels of cash flows, but if you're focusing on individual wealth growth, money-weighted return can be more insightful. Keep calculator handy and remember the context.</p><p>-christian</p></div></div></p></div>"
