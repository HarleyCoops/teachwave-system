Formally, for cash flows <Math math=\"CF_0, CF_1, \\\\dots, CF_n\" /> at times <Math math=\"t_0, t_1, \\\\dots, t_n\" />:\n<div class=\"flex justify-center\"><Math display=\"true\" math=\"\\\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\\\frac{CF_k}{(1 + r)^{t_k}} = 0\" /></div></li><li><strong>Time-Weighted Return (TWR)</strong>: TWR breaks the investment horizon into subperiods (often determined by cash flow timing), calculates the growth factor in each subperiod, and then chains them together. If the subperiod returns are <Math math=\"R_1, R_2, \\\\dots, R_m\" />, the TWR is:\n<div class=\"flex justify-center\"><Math display=\"true\" math=\"(1 + \\TWR) = (1 + R_1) \\\\times (1 + R_2) \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times (1 + R_m)\" /></div>\nwhere each <Math math=\"R_j\" /> is typically measured by changes in portfolio value in that subperiod, independent of external cash flows.</li></ul></p><p>These measures can lead to significantly different results: the IRR incorporates the size and timing of cash flows (money-weighted), whereas the TWR aims to measure the underlying performance of the investment strategy, independent of external cash flow amounts.</p></div>",

A private equity firm is evaluating its exit performance from several investments made over a five-year period, with each investment's cash flows being reinvested at irregular intervals.

The IRR is popular for private equity because it accounts for when and how much money was actually invested. But the TWR is an essential benchmark to gauge how well any investment strategy is performing on its own, without the noise of big deposits or withdrawals. You should master both, interpret them carefully, and always connect each measure back to its proper context.</p><p>-christian</p></div></div></p></div>"
